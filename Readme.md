coinched
========

`coinched` is a coinche server. It uses the internal `libcoinche` module to
model a game of coinche, and presents it as a network service, for example as
a HTTP interface.

To run the default HTTP API: `cargo run`

Note: `coinched` currently requires rust>=1.6, which won't be stable until January 20.
